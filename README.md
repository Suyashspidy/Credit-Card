# Credit-Card

Overview
This repository contains code related to credit card data analysis and modeling. It includes scripts and notebooks for various tasks such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Contents
Data Preprocessing: This section includes scripts and notebooks for cleaning and preprocessing credit card data. It covers tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Here, you'll find notebooks exploring the credit card dataset to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations between features, and identifying patterns or anomalies.

Feature Engineering: This section contains code for creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. Feature selection techniques may also be included here.

Model Building: Here, you'll find scripts and notebooks for building predictive models to detect credit card fraud or predict credit card default. Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting may be implemented.

Model Evaluation: This section includes code for evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC-ROC.
